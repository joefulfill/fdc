Information About Your Account
Making Your Payments:

The amount of your payment should be at least your minimum payment
due, payable in U.S. dollars and drawn on or payable through a U.S.
financial institution or the U.S. branch of a foreign financial institution. You
can pay down balances faster by paying more than the minimum payment
or the total unpaid balance on your account.

balance transfers, cash advances, or My Chase Loans;
2. the date the payee deposits the check - for new cash advance
checks or balance transfer checks;
3. the date of a related transaction, the date they are posted to your
account, or the last day of the billing cycle, whichever we may
choose - for fees
How To Avoid Paying Interest On Purchases:

You may make payments electronically through our website or by one of
our customer service phone numbers above. In using any of these
channels, you are authorizing us to withdraw funds as a one-time
electronic funds transfer from your bank account. In our automated phone
system, this authorization is provided via entry of a personal identification
number. You may revoke this authorization by cancelling your payment
through our website or customer service telephone numbers prior to the
payment processing. If we receive your completed payment request
through one of these channels by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time, we will credit
your payment as of that day. If we receive your request after 11:59 p.m.
Eastern Time, we will credit your payment as of the next calendar day. If
you specify a future date in your request we will credit your payment as of
that day.
If you pay by regular U.S. mail to the Payments address shown on this
statement, write your account number on your check or money order and
include the payment coupon in the envelope. Do not send more than one
payment or coupon per envelope. Do not staple, clip or tape the
documents. Do not include correspondence. Do not send cash. If we
receive your properly prepared payment on any day by 5 p.m. local time at
our Payments address on this statement, we will credit to your account
that day. If your payment is received after 5 p.m. local time at our
Payments address on this statement, we will credit it to your account as of
the next calendar day.
For all other payments or for any payment type above for which you do not
follow our payment instructions, crediting of your payments may be
delayed for up to 5 days.
Account Information Reported To Credit Bureau:

We may report information about your Account to credit bureaus. Late
payments, missed payments or other defaults on your Account may be
reflected in your credit report. If you think we have reported inaccurate
information to a credit bureau, please write to us at Chase Card Services
P.O. Box 15369, Wilmington, DE 19850-5369.
Authorization To Convert Your Check To An Electronic Transfer Debit:

When you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use
information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer
from your account or to process the payment as a check. Your bank
account may be debited as soon as the same day we receive your
payment. You will not receive your check back from your institution.
Conditional Payments:

Any payment check or other form of payment that you send us for less
than the full balance due that is marked "paid in full" or contains a similar
notation, or that you otherwise tender in full satisfaction of a disputed
amount, must be sent to Card Services, P.O. Box 15049, Wilmington, DE
19850-5049. We reserve all our rights regarding these payments (e.g., if it
is determined there is no valid dispute or if any such check is received at
any other address, we may accept the check and you still owe any
remaining balance). We may refuse to accept any such payment by
returning it to you, not cashing it or destroying it. All other payments that
you make should be sent to the regular Payment address shown on this
statement.
Annual Renewal Notice:

If your Account Agreement has an annual membership fee, you are
responsible for it every year your Account is open. We will add your
annual membership fee to your monthly billing statement once a year,
whether or not you use your account. Your annual membership fee will be
added to your purchase balance and may incur interest. The annual
membership fee is non-refundable unless you notify us that you wish to
close your account within 30 days or one billing cycle (whichever is less)
after we provide the statement on which the annual membership fee is
billed. Your payment of the annual membership fee does not affect our
rights to close your Account and to limit your right to make transactions on
your Account. If your Account is closed by you or us, the annual
membership fee will no longer be billed to your Account.
Calculation Of Balance Subject To Interest:

To figure your periodic interest charges for each billing cycle when a daily
periodic rate(s) applies, we use the daily balance method (including new
transactions). To figure your periodic interest charges for each billing cycle
when a monthly periodic rate(s) applies, we use the average daily balance
method (including new transactions). For an explanation of either method,
or questions about a particular interest charge calculation on your
statement, please call us at the toll free customer service phone number
listed above.
We calculate periodic interest charges separately for each feature (for
example, purchases (including Chase Pay Over Time plans created at
checkout with select merchants), balance transfers, cash advances, My
Chase Loan or overdraft advances). These calculations may combine
different categories with the same periodic rates. Variable rates will vary
with the market based on the Prime Rate or such index described in your
Account Agreement. There is a transaction fee for each balance transfer,
cash advance, or check transaction in the amount stated in your Account
Agreement. There is a foreign transaction fee of 3% of the U.S. dollar
amount of any foreign transaction for some accounts. For fee-based
Chase Pay Over Time plans, there is a fixed monthly fee of up to 1.72% of
the amount of each eligible purchase transaction or amount you select to
pay over time with no interest. Please see your Account Agreement for
information about these fees.

Your due date will be a minimum of 21 days after the close of each billing
cycle. If you pay your account (or Interest Saving Balance) in full each
billing period by the date and time due, no interest is charged on new
purchases month to month. Also, we will not impose interest charges on
any portion of a purchase balance you repay while that balance is subject
to an interest-free period. Subject to any interest-free period for new
purchases, we will begin charging interest from the date a transaction
(including any balance transfer, cash advance or overdraft advance), fee
or interest charge is added to your daily balance until your account is paid
in full. Because we apply payments in excess of your minimum payment
first to higher rate balances, you may not be able to avoid interest charges
on new purchases if you have another balance at a higher interest rate
unless you pay your balance (or Interest Saving Balance) in full each
month.
Credit Limit:

If you want to inquire about your options to help prevent your account from
exceeding your credit limit, please call the number on the back of your
card.
What To Do If You Think You Find A Mistake On Your Statement:

If you think there is an error on your statement, write to us on a separate
sheet at Customer Service, P.O. Box 15299, Wilmington, DE 19850-5299.
In your letter, give us the following information:
• Account information: Your name and Account number.
• Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error.
• Description of Problem: If you think there is an error on your bill,
describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a
mistake.
You must contact us within 60 days after the error appeared on your
statement.
You must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call us or
notify us electronically, but if you do we are not required to investigate any
potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.
While we investigate whether or not there has been an error, the following
are true:
• We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as
delinquent on that amount.
• The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may
continue to charge you interest on that amount. But, if we determine
that we made a mistake, you will not have to pay the amount in
question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.
• While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are
responsible for the remainder of your balance.
• We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.
Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases:

If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased
with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the
problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the
remaining amount due on the purchase.
To use the right, all of the following must be true:
1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within
100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price
must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are
necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we
mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or
services.)
2. You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases
made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that
accesses your credit card Account do not qualify.
3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.
If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the
purchase, contact us in writing at Customer Service, P.O. Box 15299,
Wilmington, DE 19850-5299.
While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as
discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our
decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay
we may report you as delinquent.

MA04012024

We add transactions and fees to your daily balance no earlier than:
