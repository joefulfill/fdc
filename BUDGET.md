## 💡 THE MINDSET SHIFT

**Old mindset:** "I make good money, I can afford it"

**New mindset:** "Every dollar I spend is a dollar I can't invest. Is this worth trading my future freedom for?"

Every $100 spent on food delivery today could be $1,700 in 30 years.

The goal isn't deprivation. The goal is **intentional spending** - spending on what actually matters and cutting what doesn't.
