# FDC Daily Schedule

## The Philosophy

You have 5 hours of real work needed. You have a family that needs you present. You have 30 lbs to cut for competition. You have a prescription that covers 30mg/day.

This schedule is designed around **constraints, not preferences**. You said it yourself: "We're trying to build something for me to become the best of the best, not something that is easy and feels good."

## Adderall Protocol

**Daily dose**: 30mg max (1.5 x 20mg tablets)

**Standard timing**:
- **20mg** with breakfast (8:00-9:00 AM depending on schedule)
- **10mg** optional at 10:30 AM if needed for afternoon focus

**Rules**:
- Never after 11:00 AM (protects sleep)
- Always with food
- Same dose every day - no binging, no skipping
- If you don't need the second 10mg, don't take it

**On early jiu jitsu days (7 AM class)**:
- Take 20mg at 9:00 AM after training and breakfast
- This is later but still gives you full work block coverage

---

## Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. **No all-nighters.** The company doesn't need them. You don't need them.

2. **Work ends when the 5 hours are done.** Not "one more thing."

3. **No stimulants after 11:00 AM.** Protect sleep at all costs.

4. **9:30 PM bedtime.** This is how you wake at 5:30 and function.

5. **Family time is sacred.** 4:00-6:00 PM minimum daily. Phone away.

6. **Train every day (Mon-Sat).** Jiu jitsu or strength. This is how you get to 155.

7. **Sunday is recovery.** Light movement only. Mental reset.

---

## Flexibility Built In

- **Home mat**: Use for extra drilling, Saturday sessions, training with friends
- **Class options**: Multiple times available most days - pick what fits
- **Tuesday/Thursday evenings**: Freed up because you train in the morning
- **Strength/cardio timing**: Flexible based on jiu jitsu schedule
