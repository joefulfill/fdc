## 🏦 PHASE 3: SET UP INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS (January)

### Retirement Account - PRIORITY #1
As a business owner, you have powerful options:

- [ ] **Research SEP-IRA vs Solo 401(k)**
  - SEP-IRA: Simpler, contribute up to 25% of net self-employment income (max $69,000 in 2024)
  - Solo 401(k): More complex but allows employee + employer contributions
  
- [ ] **Open SEP-IRA at Fidelity or Vanguard**
  - Fidelity: https://www.fidelity.com/retirement-ira/small-business/sep-ira
  - Vanguard: https://investor.vanguard.com/accounts-plans/small-business-retirement-plans/sep-ira
  
- [ ] **Make initial contribution** (can contribute for 2025 until tax filing deadline)
  - Target: $50,000+ for 2025
  - This is TAX DEDUCTIBLE - reduces your taxable income

### Taxable Brokerage Account
- [ ] **Open brokerage account at same institution** (Fidelity or Vanguard)
- [ ] **Set up automatic monthly investment** from checking
  - Start with $3,000/month
  - Increase after emergency fund is built

### Investment Choices (Keep it simple)
- [ ] **For retirement account:** Target Date Fund or Total Market Index (VTI/FSKAX)
- [ ] **For taxable account:** Total Market Index (VTI/FSKAX) + some international (VXUS/FTIHX)

## 💡 RULES TO FOLLOW

1. **Never carry a credit card balance again** - Pay in full every month
2. **Pay yourself first** - Investments come out before discretionary spending
3. **Automate everything** - Set up automatic transfers so you can't forget
4. **Don't touch retirement accounts** - Let compound interest work
5. **Live below your means** - You make $500K+, you don't need to spend like it
6. **Quarterly check-ins** - Review progress every 3 months
7. **Stay the course** - Market drops are buying opportunities, not panic moments

## 📞 PROFESSIONAL HELP TO CONSIDER

- [ ] **CPA/Tax Strategist** - Optimize business structure and distributions for taxes
- [ ] **Fee-only Financial Advisor** (optional) - One-time plan review (~$1-2K)
- [ ] **Estate Planning Attorney** - Will, trust, beneficiary designations

## 🔥 THE WHY

You're 33 with a business doing $2M+ and growing to $4.5-7M.  
You make $500K+/year combined.  
You have $0 invested.

Every year you delay costs you massively:
- $100K invested at 33, growing at 10% for 30 years = **$1.74M**
- $100K invested at 34, growing at 10% for 29 years = **$1.58M**
- **One year delay = $160K less**

The time is NOW. Not next month. Not next quarter. NOW.
