# FDC: Focus, Discipline, Consistency

## The Person Behind This System

**Joe Spisak** - 33 years old (34 in March 2025)

### Roles
- Husband and father (10-month-old son, trying for second child)
- Entrepreneur (12 years building companies, current company crushing it)
- Athlete (D1 wrestler, state champion, still trains and competes in grappling)
- Son, brother, friend

### Background
- Trained with dad (also D1 wrestler) since age 5
- State wrestling champion in high school - FDC principles come from this era
- ADHD diagnosis at age 18
- Stoic philosophy resonates deeply (Marcus Aurelius)
- Loves reading but hasn't had time in recent years due to work focus
- Got burnt out on self-help books - found many generic and gimmicky
- Built current company to the point where it runs autonomously with the right team
- Has been "burnt" by past company failures - this created lasting fear

### The Dad Factor
Joe's father is the central figure in his development. Key context:
- Dad is "the best dude in the world" - a model father
- D1 wrestler who trained Joe since age 5
- Always had Joe's back, always involved in his life
- Worked incredibly hard to provide for Joe and his three sisters
- The core reason Joe works so hard - wants to honor what his parents sacrificed
- Joe feels it would be "the ultimate disrespect" not to make it big given their sacrifices
- Still scraps/trains with dad today
- Joe wants to invest money with dad but hasn't figured out strategy yet
- Dad represents what Joe wants to become for his own son

### The Dream
The deepest motivation: gain enough wealth that his extended family (parents, wife's parents, wife's brother, three sisters and their families) never has to worry about money again. Financial freedom for everyone he loves. He's been chasing this dream for 12 years and feels he's a few years away from achieving it.

## The Core Insight

**You've already won. The machine is built.**

The company is in a strong growth cycle. The team is in place. It can grow autonomously. But you're still operating like it's survival mode - stimulant-fueled all-nighters, sprint/crash cycles, fear-driven overwork.

The fear of failure is running an outdated program. Time to update the operating system.

---

## What's Currently Broken

### The Sprint/Crash Cycle
- 2-3 week work sprints with 1-2 all-nighters per week
- High-dose stimulants during sprints, nothing during recovery
- Currently typing at 4:30 AM - no consistent sleep schedule
- Wife wakes at 6 AM, son at 6:30 AM - you're often asleep or depleted

### The Imbalance
- Work gets full intensity, everything else gets leftovers
- 30 pounds over competition weight (185 vs 155 target)
- Not feeling healthy
- "Making it up as I go" each day - no structure

### The Fear
- Past company failures created fear of losing what you've built
- This fear drives overwork even though the company doesn't need it
- Wife has flagged the stimulant pattern as a concern

---

## The Vision

### Who You Want to Be
Someone your son, wife, parents, sisters, and friends look at and feel inspired by. A leader by example.

### For Your Son
- Mold him into a champion (however that manifests for him)
- Let him stand on the shoulders of a giant, like you did with your dad
- Expose him to grappling community - Joe and his best friends are elite grapplers and great role models
- Initial plan is wrestling as the vehicle (the path Joe knows, teaches life lessons, builds character)
- But: stay open to who the son is meant to become - nurture whatever path he chooses as he matures
- Model what a good man looks like - teach him to love hard things and competition
- Raise him to change the world in a positive manner

### For Your Family
- Generational wealth: enough that extended family never worries about money
- Present and engaged, not a roommate who surfaces between work binges
- True partner to your wife

### For Yourself
- Best version across all domains
- Compete at highest level in jiu jitsu (blue belt world title goal)
- Sustainable energy and focus without abusing stimulants
- Health optimization (bloodwork, vitamins, longevity)

## The Principles

### FDC - Focus, Discipline, Consistency
The three pillars from your wrestling days. How you win state titles. How you build companies.

### The Fourth Principle: Wisdom
FDC tells you *how* to execute. Wisdom tells you *what deserves* your focus, discipline, and consistency. Without wisdom, you can FDC your way to a billion dollars and a broken family.

## Current State Snapshot

### Schedule
- **Current wake time**: Sporadic (depends on all-nighters, sometimes sleeping in late)
- **Wife's wake time**: 6:00 AM
- **Son's wake time**: 6:30 AM
- **Ideal**: Consistent schedule aligned with family

### Commitments
- Both work from home
- Fully flexible - no fixed meetings or obligations
- This is a gift: complete control over schedule design

### Health
- **Current weight**: 189 lbs (as of December 1, 2025)
- **Competition weight**: 155 lbs (wrestled 133-141 in college, knows how to cut)
- **Weight to lose**: 34 lbs
- **Goal**: Compete in jiu jitsu tournaments next year, win blue belt worlds
- **Training access**: Gym membership + mat at home
- **Needs**: Diet plan, training schedule, bloodwork/health optimization, sustainable stimulant protocol
- **Diet notes**: Can eat fish ~1x/week max, prefers easy prep for wife

### Stimulant Protocol (Current)
- **Prescription**: Adderall 20mg IR tablets, 45 units/month
- **Intended use**: 1.5 tablets/day (30mg) = 30 days coverage
- **Current pattern**: Binge during work sprints (likely exceeding 30mg), nothing during crash periods
- **Goal**: Sustainable daily protocol aligned with schedule, not binge/crash

### Work
- Company runs autonomously with right team in place
- Current income target: $375k-$500k/year
- Exit goal: $10-50M
- Investment strategy to build with dad (not yet defined)
- **Actual hours needed**: ~5 hours/day of focused work (Joe's honest estimate)
- **Mindset**: "We're trying to build something for me to become the best of the best, not something that is easy and feels good"

## What FDC (The System) Must Deliver

1. **Comprehensive daily schedule** - wake time, work blocks, training, family time, sleep
2. **Locked-in diet** - specific meals to cut to 155 lbs while maintaining energy
3. **Stimulant protocol** - when/if to take, proper medical guidance
4. **Training program** - jiu jitsu competition prep, strength/conditioning
5. **Health optimization** - bloodwork baseline, vitamins, longevity protocols
6. **Work structure** - focused hours that replace chaotic sprints
7. **Family time protection** - non-negotiables, not leftovers
8. **Weekly/monthly review** - course correction and accountability

## Key Pushback to Remember

These are challenges that emerged during the foundational conversation. Future agents should reinforce these perspectives:

1. **On your son**: Give him a forge, but stay open to who he's meant to become. Wrestling is a clear path now; things change. Marcus Aurelius didn't write about making his children into copies of himself - he wrote about helping them become who *they* are meant to be.

2. **On being hard on yourself**: Joe acknowledged being very hard on himself - "a curse and a blessing." Reality check: it's mostly a curse that occasionally produces results. The Stoics didn't teach self-flagellation; they taught clear-eyed assessment and action. There's a difference between "I fell short and will do better" (useful) and "I'm not good enough" (corrosive). The second will bleed into parenting.

3. **On the work pattern**: You're not behind. You're not about to fail. The company is crushing it. Work from abundance, not fear. The question "if you cut work hours by 30%, what would break?" yielded "nothing" - proof the fear is outdated.

4. **On FDC principles**: These are execution virtues (the *how*). They're missing direction virtues (the *what* and *why*). You could FDC your way to a billion dollars and a broken family. Add wisdom/discernment to know what deserves focus.

5. **On the stimulant cycle**: This is unsustainable. Sprint/crash is not Focus, Discipline, Consistency - it's intensity followed by depletion. Borrowing from health, presence as a father, and marriage to fund work sprints. Wife is right to flag it.

---

## What Comes Next

1. Define ideal daily schedule structure
2. Create cutting diet plan (185 → 155)
3. Design training program for competition
4. Establish stimulant/health protocol (with medical input)
5. Build work blocks that replace sprints
6. Set up accountability and tracking systems
7. Get bloodwork baseline

## How to Work With Joe

Guidelines for future agents/sessions:

1. **Be an honest counselor** - Joe explicitly asked for pushback and honesty. He needs a partner who challenges him, not one who validates everything. Disagree when necessary.

2. **No generic self-help** - He's burnt out on gimmicky content. Be specific, practical, grounded. Skip the motivational fluff.

3. **Reference Stoicism** - Marcus Aurelius resonates. Frame things in Stoic terms when relevant.

4. **Remember the fear** - When Joe starts overworking or sprinting, it's likely the old fear pattern. Gently call it out.

5. **Family is the point** - Work is in service of family, not the other way around. If advice optimizes for business at the expense of presence with wife/son, it's wrong.

6. **He's already successful** - Don't treat him like he's struggling. The company is crushing it. He needs optimization, not rescue.

7. **The wrestler mindset** - He responds to challenge, competition, hard truths. Don't coddle. He was forged in a wrestling room, not a therapy office.
