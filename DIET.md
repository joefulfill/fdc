# FDC Diet Plan

## The Goal

- **Starting weight**: 189 lbs (December 1, 2025)
- **Target weight**: 155 lbs
- **Weight to lose**: 34 lbs
- **Timeline**: 3 months (end of February 2026)
- **Rate**: ~2.5-3 lbs/week

This is an aggressive cut. You know how to do this from wrestling. The difference now: you're doing it sustainably, not crash-cutting for a weigh-in.

## The Math

**Estimated maintenance calories** (189 lb active male, training 2x/day): ~2,800-3,000 cal

**Target deficit**: 1,000-1,250 cal/day (for 2-2.5 lbs/week fat loss)

**Daily calorie target**: **1,800 calories**

We start here. If weight loss stalls, we adjust. If energy crashes, we adjust. But this is the starting point.

## Macros

| Macro | Target | Why |
|-------|--------|-----|
| **Protein** | 180g | Preserve muscle while cutting. ~1g per lb current weight. |
| **Carbs** | 120g | Fuel for training. Not keto, but controlled. |
| **Fat** | 60g | Minimum for hormones and satiety. |

**Calories from macros**: (180 x 4) + (120 x 4) + (60 x 9) = 720 + 480 + 540 = 1,740 cal

Buffer of ~60 cal for vegetables, seasoning, etc.

## Rules

1. **No eating out.** This is the biggest change. Restaurant food is impossible to track accurately and almost always higher calorie than you think. 3 months. No exceptions.

2. **Weigh yourself every morning.** After bathroom, before food/water. Track it. We need data.

3. **Hit protein first.** If you're going to miss a macro, don't let it be protein. Muscle preservation is critical during a cut.

4. **Drink water.** Minimum 1 gallon per day. Helps with hunger, recovery, and performance.

5. **No liquid calories.** Water, black coffee, unsweetened tea only. No alcohol during the cut.

6. **Eat on schedule.** Meals at consistent times help regulate hunger and energy.

7. **If you're starving, eat protein.** Extra chicken breast is better than breaking and eating garbage.

---

## Adjustments

**If weight loss is faster than 3 lbs/week**: Add 100-200 calories (extra carbs around training)

**If weight loss stalls for 2+ weeks**: Drop to 1,600 calories, add 15 min cardio to training days

**If energy is tanking**: Add 50g carbs on heavy training days (pre-jiu jitsu)

**2 weeks out from competition**: We'll implement a water cut protocol. Not before.

---

## Tracking

Use an app (MyFitnessPal, MacroFactor, or similar) or a simple notebook.

Log:
- Morning weight
- All food eaten
- Water intake
- Training completed
- Energy level (1-10)
- Sleep quality (1-10)

Review weekly on Sundays during your weekly review.
