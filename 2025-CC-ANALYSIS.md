## 🏆 THE MATH THAT MATTERS

If you save $55,200/year (from spending cuts) + eliminate $8,500/year interest:
- **Year 1:** $63,700 saved
- **Invested at 10% over 10 years:** $1,104,000
- **Invested at 10% over 20 years:** $4,000,000+

This is the difference between generational wealth and paycheck-to-paycheck.

The choice is yours. Every day.
